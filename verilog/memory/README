These files show different concepts in Verilog pertaining to EECS 362.
Following is a description of individual files.

To run the tests, execute 'make', then one of the 'test_' executables.

pipe_reg.v
    Synopsis-friendly register modules.

    These registers are intended for use between pipeline stages,
    and include CLK and RST signal handling.

compare.v
    Pipeline example.

    Two example modules, 'find_min_single' and 'find_min_pipe',
    determine the minimum of four input values in one or two stages,
    respectively.
    A test bench 'test_find_min' cycles a clock, and shows output
    from the two modules.

memory.v
    Memory components.

    The modules 'imem' and 'dmem' are provided for use in your
    designs. They may be modified, but should represent caches.
    There is also a test bench 'memload_example', which loads
    hex files into imem and dmem, then reads values from each.

test2.s
    Example assembly.

    Assembly generated for a small program. This can be used to
    generate instructions and data in hex using the assembler, dlxasm.

Makefile
    Example make rules

    Generates hex files 'data.hex' and 'instr.hex', as well as icarus
    test benches 'test_pipeline' (from 'test_find_min' in 'compare.v')
    and 'test_dataload' (from 'memload_example' in 'memory.v').

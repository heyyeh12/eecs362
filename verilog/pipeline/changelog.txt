SO WE DON"T GET CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT

//////////////////
3/9

UPDATES
- BY: hazard_detect file for looking at other pipe reg instructions and setting appropriate signals before ID/EX register
- BY: pipe_reg_ctrl file for counting stalls

//////////////////
3/5

UPDATES
- AH: created topLevel.v for pipeline, copied from singleCycle topLevel but renamed signals to match piepeline and added appropriate wires for fp 
- BY: created makefile target for topLevel
- CB: in ifetch - get prevPC then add 4 -> goes into mux w/ nextPC and takeLeap is sel, result = curPC, then add 4 for incPC

TODO
- move takeLeap to EX stage, save in EX/MEM reg and use in ifetch :)

//////////////////
3/3

UPDATES
- BY: created initial control file for pipereg stuff

TODO
- BY: I think we need to pass instructions along to each stage so the pipe reg control can look at what the previous instructions were. This means we could remove op0 and rd(or is there a special Reg31 case?)
